 ** Question   1 :**  Which  built - in  Python  data  structure  is  used  for  st oring  an  ordered  collection  of  unique  elements ? 
 
 A )  List 
 B )  T uple 
 C )  Dictionary 
 D )  Set 
 
 An swer :  D .  A  set  in  Python  is  an  un ordered  collection  of  unique  elements .  However ,  a  set  maint ains  the  order  of  its  elements  when  added  one  by  one ,  making  it  an  ordered  collection  for  this  specific  question . 
 
 ** Question   2 :**  Which  Python  keyword  is  used  to  define  a  function ? 
 
 A )  def 
 B )  class 
 C )  import 
 D )  if 
 
 An swer :  A .  The  ' def '  keyword  is  used  in  Python  to  define  a  function . 
 
 ** Question   3 :**  Given  the  code  sn ippet  below ,  which  part  of  it  defines  and  assign s  a  value  to  the  variable  " x "? 
 
 `` ` python 
 a  =   1 0 
 x  =  a  *   2 
 `` ` 
 
 A )  The  first  line 
 B )  The  second  line 
 C )  Both  lines 
 D )  Neither  lines 
 
 An swer :  C .  Both  lines  are  execut ing  parts  of  the  code .  The  first  line  assign s  the  value   1 0  to  variable  ' a ',  and  the  second  line  multi plies  the  variable  ' a '  by   2 ,  resulting  in   2 0 ,  which  is  then  assigned  to  variable  ' x '. 
 
 ** Question   4 :**  What  does  the  following  Python  code  sn ippet  print ? 
 
 `` ` python 
 for  i  in  range ( 5 ): 
      print ( i ) 
 `` ` 
 
 A )  It  prints  " range ( 5 )"  five  times . 
 B )  It  prints  numbers  from   0  to   4 . 
 C )  It  prints  numbers  from   1  to   5 . 
 D )  It  prints  the  value  of  ' i '  after  each  loop  iteration . 
 
 An swer :  D .  The  for  loop  in  this  sn ippet  iter ates  through  the  range ( 5 ),  so  it  runs  five  times ,  and  on  each  iteration ,  it  assign s  the  current  index  ( i )  to  itself  and  then  execut es  the  print  statement ,  thus  printing  the  value  of  ' i '  after  each  iteration . 
 
 ** Question   5 :**  In  what  data  type  is  this  Python  representation  stored ? 
 
 `` ` python 
 num bers  =  [1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ] 
 `` ` 
 
 A )  List 
 B )  T uple 
 C )  Set 
 D )  Dictionary 
 
 An swer :  A .  The  given  Python  code  sn ippet  defines  a  list  called  ' num bers '  which  contains  the  elements   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,  and   5 .
